# Example of how to create a demo app with waylay-js

Please check the [config.js](js/config.js) to setup the right domain. 
Demo is written in jQuery :), nothing fancy. Should be easy to convert it to react or vue or whatever. 

## Who is this for?

In case you want to create your custom dashbaords, widgets or rules, it is always good to code from the example. Idea behind this project is to give you some ideas. Most of the examples are simple, you can browse the code and see how we fetch data, how we list or start new tasks, or how we search for alarms. 
THere is only one waylay package in this app, which is based on this [sdk](https://sdk.waylay.io/).
